# Neural-Network-based-on-Cellular-Automata

# Overview
This project presents the concept and application of one-dimensional cellular automata rules as a tool for creating artificial neural networks, enabling the creation, training and testing of such a network.
* Define initial states, rules and expected outputs,
* Configure number of hidden layers of cellular automata rules,
* Train the system using genetic algorithm principles,
* Visualize network structures and training results,
* Process and analyze rule performance.

# Key Features
* Neural Network Inspired Architecture: Uses layers of cellular automata rules as processing units,
* Evolutionary Training: Implements rule replacement based on performance scores,
* Visualization Tools: Network structure visualization and rule performance analysis,
* File Processing: Load training data from files and save test results,
* Dynamic Adjustment: Configurable crossover probabilities and dynamic training parameters

# Installation
Clone the repository and install required dependencies:
```bash
gh repo clone DawidDziedzic2359/Neural-Network-based-on-Cellular-Automata
cd Neural-Network-based-on-Cellular-Automata
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
Run the main application:
```bash
python main.py
```

# Basic Workflow:
1. Configure initial state (manual input, from file, or random generation),
2. Set number of hidden layers,
3. Set odd string length in size of each sequence,
4. Set expected output pattern,
5. Define rules (manual input, from file, or random generation),
6. Choose training parameters,
7. Run training (step-by-step or until success),
8. Analyze results and visualize network performance.

# Example Use Cases
* Pattern recognition and transformation,
* Binary sequence generation,
* Educational tool for studying cellular automata,
* Evolutionary algorithm experimentation.
